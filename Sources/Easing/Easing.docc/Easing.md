# ``Easing``

Simple implementation of Easing functions in Swift.


## Overview

Easing functions are useful for modelling the acceleration or change in speed over time.

Objects in a physical world donâ€™t just jump from one position to another instantly, and the velocity at which they move is almost never constant. Natural movement is usually more accurately described mathematically by non-linear functions.
