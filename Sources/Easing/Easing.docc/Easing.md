# ``Easing``

A package that implements Easing functions in Swift.


## Overview

Easing functions are useful for modelling the acceleration or change in speed over time.

Objects in a physical world donâ€™t just jump from one position to another instantly, and the velocity at which they move is almost never constant. Natural movement is usually more accurately described mathematically by non-linear functions.

### Supported easing curves:

-  ``Easing/Curve/quadratic``
-  ``Easing/Curve/cubic``
-  ``Easing/Curve/quartic``
-  ``Easing/Curve/quintic``
-  ``Easing/Curve/sine``
-  ``Easing/Curve/circular``
-  ``Easing/Curve/exponential``
-  ``Easing/Curve/elastic``
-  ``Easing/Curve/back``
-  ``Easing/Curve/bounce``

Each type has its own separate ``Easing/Curve/easeIn``, ``Easing/Curve/easeOut`` and ``Easing/Curve/easeInOut`` form.

The functions are design to accept a generic floating-point input parameter,
and return a floating-point, denoting the rate of change of a property over time.

Supported argument types: 
- Any type that conforms to the [Real](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics) protocol, e.g.
     - `Float`
     - `Float80`
     - `Double`
     
### Usage:

The ``Curve`` type allows access to all the different functions, for example:

```swift
let x: Float = 0.3
let y = Curve.quadratic.easeIn(x) // y = 0.09
```

```swift
let x: Double = 0.5
let y = Curve.sine.easeOut(x2) // y = 0.7071067811865    
```
